# WhichPlane

Currently, this project is an Android app for tracking planes which are nearby (within a 50km radius).  The app is made using React Native. The app uses data from the data from the [OpenSky Live Rest API](https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/index.html).  Google Maps SDK for Android is used for the map on the app. 

Future work involves increasing or reducing the radius from between 5km-100km based on user choice, and adding support for iOS.
